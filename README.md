# VisualTorch
Visualtorch is a Python package to help visualize torch (either standalone or included in pytorch) neural network architectures. It allows easy styling to fit most needs. This module supports layered style architecture generation which is great for CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), and a graph style architecture, which works great for most models including plain feed-forward networks.

This work is inspired from "paulgavrikov/visualkeras" which is makeing layers from Tensorflow and Keras, and using styles of "HarisIqbal88/PlotNeuralNet" to make it ready to work.
